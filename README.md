discord bot scraper compatible with [my discord archive viewer](https://raincandy.lol/discord)

youre expected to have some knowledge on discord bots/python if using and is very standard if so. it will directly download the servers contents (including images, videos, mp4s and text) onto your hard drive. 
it is recommended to use an external hard drive for larger servers. if the process is interrupted in any form, such as ctrl + c, disconnected internet or switching discord accounts during the process, it will resume from the last message id saved.

make a .env with your discord bot token inside, make sure to give it the correct permissions stated inside the .py
